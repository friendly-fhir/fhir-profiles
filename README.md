# FHIR Profiles

This repository houses definitions of FHIR profiles for the [FHIR] standard,
defined as [`StructureDefinition`] resources in JSON format.

This is largely just a re-hosting of the same data that is able to be found on
the FHIR website, but more easily accessible for use in other tools and systems.

# License

This repository does not own any of the structure-definitions that are included,
and as such does not provide any license for them. Any tooling and scripts are
dual-licensed under the MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses, at your option.
